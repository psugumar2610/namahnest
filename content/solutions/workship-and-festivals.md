###### **Grand Festivals – Thiruvizha**

The temple celebrates many festivals every year. The four most important ones are called Thiruvizha (grand festivals).

The biggest festival is held during the Tamil month of Karthikai (November–December). It lasts for ten days and ends with the Karthigai Deepam celebration. On this special day, a huge lamp is lit on top of Annamalai Hill, using over three tons of ghee in a large cauldron. This sacred flame is visible from miles away.

On this day, the procession idol of Annamalaiyar is taken in a grand wooden chariot around the temple and hill.

Inscriptions tell us that this festival has been celebrated since the Chozha dynasty (850–1280 CE) and was extended to ten days in the 20th century.

###### **Girivalam – Full Moon Circumambulation**

Every full moon night, tens of thousands of devotees come to circumambulate the Annamalai Hill barefoot, a sacred practice known as Girivalam. This walk covers around 14 kilometers (8.7 miles).

According to Hindu belief, this walk:
Removes sins\
Fulfills desires\
Leads to moksha (freedom from rebirth)\
During Girivalam, devotees visit and make offerings at various tanks, shrines, meditation halls, springs, and caves along the way.

On Chithra Pournami, the full moon day of the Tamil month Chithirai, hundreds of thousands of people come from across the world to worship Annamalaiyar. During this time, the temple’s five wooden chariots (thaers) with intricate carvings are used for a grand procession.

###### **Thiruvoodal Festival – Divine Play**

Another beautiful festival called Thiruvoodal is celebrated during the first week of Thai month (mid-January).

On the day of Maattu Pongal (January 15 or 16), the sacred bull Nandhi is decorated with garlands made from fruits, vegetables, and sweets.

In the evening, the processional deities Annamalaiyar and Unnamulai Amman are brought out of the temple to Thiruvoodal Street. There, they enact a divine love play (oodal), representing a small disagreement and reunion between the divine couple—a moment of devotion and joy for all devotees.


###### **Daily Rituals and Temple Priests**

The poosai (daily rituals) and festival worship at the Annamalaiyar Temple are carried out by trained priests from the Saivaite Brahmin community, just like in other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.

**There are six main rituals performed each day:**

Kaalaippani – 5:30 a.m\
Kaalai Vazhipaadu – 8:00 a.m\
Nadunchama Vazhipaadu – 10:00 a.m\
Maalaipani – 6:00 p.m\
Irandaam Kaalai Pani – 8:00 p.m\
Iravuppani – 10:00 p.m

**Each ritual includes four sacred steps:**

Thirumanjanam (holy bath)\
Alangaaram (decorating the deity)\
Neivedhiyam (offering food), and\
Theepa Arathanai (waving of lamps).

These rituals are performed for both Annamalaiyar and Unnamulai Amman, with the sound of nagaswaram (traditional wind instrument), tavil (drum), chanting of Vedic hymns, and devotees offering full-body prostration near the temple mast.
