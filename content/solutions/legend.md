###### **The Divine Test by Lord Shiva**

Once, a disagreement arose between Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu. Each one believed that he was greater than the other. To teach them the truth and guide them, Lord Shiva appeared as a huge pillar of endless fire, called the Jyoti Sthambha (Pillar of Light).

###### **Brahma and Vishnu Begin the Search**

To decide who was supreme, Shiva said: "Whoever finds the top or the bottom of this fire pillar will be the greatest."
**Lord Brahma took the form of a swan and flew up to find the top.**
**Lord Vishnu became a boar (Varaha) and dug deep into the earth to find the base.**

###### **Vishnu's Humility and Brahma’s Ego**

Vishnu searched deeply but could not find the end. He humbly accepted that he failed and admitted Shiva’s greatness.
Brahma, however, lied. He said he had found the top and brought a Thazhampoo (Ketaki flower) as false proof.

###### **Shiva Reveals the Truth**

Lord Shiva was angry with Brahma’s dishonesty. He removed Brahma’s fifth head and cursed him that no temples would be built solely for him.
Shiva was pleased with Vishnu’s honesty and blessed him with divine grace.

###### **The Birth of Annamalai Hill**

Both Brahma and Vishnu then understood that Lord Shiva is the Supreme Truth — one who has no beginning and no end, beyond creation and preservation.
To bless the world, Shiva took the form of Annamalai Hill in Tiruvannamalai, symbolizing the element of fire (Agni), one of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams.

###### **The Lingodbhava Form of Shiva**

Later, Lord Shiva appeared in the form of a Lingam, called Lingodbhava, showing that He is formless, endless, and beyond human understanding.
This sacred moment is remembered in every Shiva temple through the Lingodbhava murti, usually seen on the western wall of the main shrine.

###### **The Meaning Behind Karthigai Deepam**

This divine event is also remembered during the Karthigai Deepam festival, when a giant flame is lit on top of Annamalai Hill. This flame shows Lord Shiva’s form as infinite light (Jyoti) — a symbol of truth, divinity, and eternity.

###### **The Meaning of "Annamalai"**

In Tamil, the word "Aṇnudhal" means "to come near." The word "Aṇṇā" means "that which cannot be approached."
Since even Brahma and Vishnu could not reach the top or bottom of Shiva’s fire form, the hill was named Annamalai, which means:
“The Hill that cannot be measured” or “The Inaccessible Hill.”
