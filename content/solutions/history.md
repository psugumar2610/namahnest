###### **Early Devotional Records by Saint-Poets**

In the 7th century CE, the great Shaivite saints Sambandar and Appar, known as the Nayanmars, praised Annamalaiyar Temple in their devotional hymns called Thevaram.
Sekkizhar, the famous poet of the Periyapuranam, also wrote that both Sambandar and Appar visited and worshipped Lord Annamalaiyar at this temple. In later times, the temple was also known as the Arunachalesvara Temple.

###### **Patronage by the Chozha Dynasty**

The powerful Chozha kings ruled this region from around 850 CE to 1280 CE. They were great supporters of this temple.
Inscriptions from their rule mention many gifts given to the temple, such as land, cows, sheep, and oil, often offered in celebration of their victories and devotion.

###### **Hoysala and Vijayanagara Contributions**

In 1328 CE, the Hoysala kings made Tiruvannamalai their capital.
Later, the Vijayanagara Empire also supported the temple. There are:
> 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE),
> 2 inscriptions from the Saluva Dynasty, and
> 55 inscriptions from the Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE).
These records show the gifts and support the temple received from their rulers

###### **Krishnadeva Raya’s Support**

One of the most powerful Vijayanagara kings, Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529 CE), also offered support to this temple.
Most inscriptions from this time are in Tamil, and some are in Kannada and Sanskrit. They usually focus on local matters and temple administration, unlike the royal style of inscriptions found in places like Tirupati.

###### **Modern Management of the Temple**

Since 1951, the temple has been maintained by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board (HR & CE), under the Government of Tamil Nadu, as per the HR & CE Act.

In 2002, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the Annamalaiyar Temple a national heritage monument and took over its care.
However, due to strong public protests and a legal case in the Supreme Court of India, the ASI later returned control to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board.
