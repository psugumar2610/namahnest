###### **Complex and towers**

The Annamalaiyar Temple is located at the base of the Annamalai Hills and faces east. The entire temple complex spreads across 25 acres of land. The outer walls measure about 700 feet (210 meters) on the east and west sides, 1,479 feet (451 meters) on the south side, and 1,590 feet (480 meters) on the north side. The present-day stone structures and towers are believed to have been built in the 9th century CE, as confirmed by inscriptions from the Chozha kings who ruled during that time.

Inscriptions also reveal that before the Chozhas, the Thiruvannamalai region was ruled by the Pallava kings from Kanchipuram. The temple has four grand gateway towers called Gopurams, one on each side. Among them, the eastern tower, known as the Rajagopuram, is the tallest. Its base is made of strong granite and measures 135 feet (41 meters) by 98 feet (30 meters). The construction of this tower was started by King Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara dynasty, who ruled between 1509 and 1529 CE. It was later completed by Sevappa Nayaka, who ruled from 1532 to 1580 CE.

Inscriptions tell us that the tower was built in 1572 CE by the efforts of two brothers, Sivanesa and Lokanatha. The southern tower is called Thirumanchana Gopuram, the western one is known as Pe Gopuram, and the northern tower is referred to as Ammani Amman Gopuram. Ancient texts like Raghunathabhyudayam and Sangitha Sudha, both belonging to the Nayak period, also describe these towers. Another record, Tanjavuri Andhra Raja Charitamu, mentions that King Krishnadevaraya built the Rajagopuram and the outer structures of the temple.

The temple has five main enclosures, known as precincts. Inside each of these precincts, there is a large statue of Nandi, the sacred bull and devoted vehicle of Lord Shiva. Some other well-known towers in the temple complex include the Vallala Maharaja Gopuram and the Kili Gopuram, also known as the Parrot Tower.

###### **Shrines**

The main shrine of Lord Annamalaiyar (also called Arunachalesvara) faces east and is the oldest structure in the temple. Inside this sanctum, you can see the images of Nandhi, the sacred bull of Shiva, and Surya, the Sun God.

Just behind the inner walls of the sanctum, there is an image of Venugopalaswamy, a form of Lord Krishna, who is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Around the main shrine, you will find several other divine images, including Somakanthar, Durga, Chandeshvara, Gajalakshmi, Arumugaswami, Dakshinamoorthy, Swarnabhairava, Nataraja, and Lingodbhavar, which shows Lord Shiva emerging from a Lingam to reveal his endless form.

The Palliyarai, the divine resting room for the deities, is located in the first enclosure around the sanctum. The shrine of Goddess Annamalai Amman, Lord Shiva’s consort, is in the second enclosure. She is seen in a standing posture, blessing the devotees.

To the north of the temple’s flagstaff and the Bali Peeta (the sacred offering platform), you will find the shrine of Sambantha Pillaiyar, a form of Lord Ganesha. Towards the south of the famous thousand-pillared hall, there is a small shrine for Lord Subramanya (Murugan) and a large sacred tank.

There is also a special underground shrine called the Pathala Lingam, which is believed to be the place where Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879–1950 CE) performed deep penance and attained spiritual wisdom.

On the northern bank of the Sivagangai tank, there is a shrine dedicated to Sivagangai Pillaiyar, another form of Lord Ganesha.

###### **Halls**

In the third enclosure of the temple, there is a beautiful sixteen-pillared hall called the Theepa Kaatchi Arangam, also known as the Hall of Light. This sacred space is used during special lamp-lighting ceremonies.

The temple’s holy tree, the Magizha tree, is considered sacred and medicinal. Devotees, especially childless couples, tie small cradles to its branches as a prayer for children and blessings. According to the Vedas, the main mast (dwajasthambam) of the temple is said to have separated heaven and earth during the creation of the universe.

The Thirumana Mandapam, or wedding hall, is located in the south-west area of the precinct and is built in the elegant Vijayanagara architectural style. Outside the temple, there is a stone trident (Trishula) placed in the open air, surrounded by protective railings, much like a sacred tree, showing its divine importance.

Another structure called the Ilavenil Mandapam, meaning Hall of Spring, is also found in the third enclosure. It houses the temple office and the shrine of Kalahateeswarar, another form of Lord Shiva.

In the fourth enclosure, there are several sacred spots, including an image of Nandhi, the Brahma Nanneer (holy water source), a temple tank, and the shrine of Yanai Thirai Konda Pillaiyar, a form of Lord Ganesha. This area also has a special hall with a six-foot-tall statue of Nandhi, built by King Vallala Maharaja in devotion.

As you enter through the first temple tower and reach the fifth enclosure, you will see the magnificent thousand-pillared hall, which was constructed during the late Vijayanagara period. The great King Krishnadevaraya built this grand hall and also created the large temple tank in front of it for devotees.

The pillars of this hall are beautifully carved with figures of Yali, a powerful mythical creature that has the body of a lion and the head of an elephant. The Yali is a symbol of strength and protection, often linked to the Nayak dynasty.

Nearby, you can find the Arunagirinathar Mandapam, dedicated to the saint Arunagirinathar, located on the right side of the Kalayana Linga Sundara Eswara Mandapam. On the left side, you will see the shrine of Gopurathilayanar, situated beside a wide flight of stone steps that lead to the Vallala Gopuram, one of the temple’s grand towers.
