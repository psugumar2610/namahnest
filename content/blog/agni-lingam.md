## Agni Lingam – Location

The Agni Lingam is located on the southeastern stretch of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the Seshadri Ashram and Lotus Tank. This is the second Lingam encountered during the Girivalam (circumambulation) and is uniquely positioned on the right-hand side of the path—unlike the others.

This Lingam represents the Southeast direction and is associated with Leo (Simha) zodiac sign. It was consecrated by Agni, the Fire God and one of the Pancha Bhootas. Devotees believe that worshipping at this Lingam bestows purification, strength, health, and vitality.

## Historical Significance
According to legend, the Fire God Agni suffered from internal impurities and sought relief from Lord Shiva. As part of his divine journey, he arrived at Thiruvannamalai and performed penance. Lord Shiva, in his infinite compassion, granted him purification and spiritual strength.

In gratitude and devotion, Agni consecrated this Lingam, which came to represent the cleansing and illuminating power of fire. The Lingam continues to be revered for its ability to burn away sins and purify one’s karma.

## Mythological Background
As told in ancient scriptures, Agni Deva once incurred sin from consuming impurities during various sacrificial rituals. Weakened and restless, he wandered across sacred lands to regain his purity. At Thiruvannamalai, in the presence of the sacred Arunachala hill, he meditated upon Lord Shiva.

Lord Shiva appeared before him, absolved him of his afflictions, and blessed him with renewed strength. To commemorate this divine moment, Agni installed this Lingam—now known to help devotees cleanse their sins and regain vigor.
