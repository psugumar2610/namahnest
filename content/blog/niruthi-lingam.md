## Niruthi Lingam – Location

The Niruthi Lingam is located on the southwestern side of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai. It is the fourth Lingam encountered during the sacred circumambulation. This Lingam lies in a quieter stretch of the path and is revered for its deep, protective energy.

This Lingam represents the Southwest direction and is associated with the Pisces (Meena) and Sagittarius (Dhanus) zodiac signs. It was consecrated by Niruthi, the guardian deity of the Southwest, often linked with protection and karmic purification. Devotees believe that praying here helps remove ancestral curses, negative energies, and grants fame and childbirth blessings.

## Historical Significance

According to sacred lore, Niruthi, the guardian of the Southwest, desired release from dark forces and karmic entanglements that affected the realms he watched over. In search of divine support, he came to Thiruvannamalai and surrendered himself in prayer to Lord Shiva.

Moved by his humility and devotion, Lord Shiva appeared and blessed him with divine clarity and strength. In profound gratitude, Niruthi installed this Lingam. It is now worshipped by devotees who seek to be freed from long-standing family curses, unseen negative influences, and to receive blessings of prosperity and purity.

## Mythological Background

As per ancient scriptures, Niruthi once took on the burden of guarding paths that were corrupted by dark forces and adharma (unrighteousness). To purify his soul and lineage, he undertook a pilgrimage and arrived at Arunachala. He meditated in solitude among dense trees and sacred winds, praying for Shiva’s grace.

Shiva, appearing as Arunachala, sanctified Niruthi’s spirit and transformed his karmic energies. In response, Niruthi consecrated this Lingam as a symbol of protection and ancestral healing.

## Significance During Girivalam

During Pournami Girivalam, stopping at the Niruthi Lingam is considered vital for those seeking spiritual cleansing and karmic relief. The blessings associated with this Lingam include:
