## Indra Lingam – Location

The Indra Lingam is situated on the eastern side of the Arunachaleswarar Temple in Thiruvannamalai, along Karu Street. It is the first Lingam encountered on the sacred Girivalam (circumambulation) path. On Pournami (Full Moon) days, devotees begin their Girivalam by offering prayers at this Lingam.

This Lingam represents the East direction and is associated with the Taurus (Rishabha) and Libra (Tula) zodiac signs. Indra, the King of the Devas (Celestial Beings), is believed to have consecrated this Lingam. Worshipping here is believed to bestow good health, mental strength, fame, and leadership qualities.

## Historical Significance

According to legend, Indra grew arrogant due to his immense power and authority. As a result, he lost both his status and fame in the celestial realm. In great sorrow, he came to Thiruvannamalai and meditated on Lord Shiva.

Moved by his sincere penance, Lord Shiva appeared in the form of Arunachala, removed Indra’s ego, guided him toward righteousness, and restored his glory and divine position.

In gratitude, Indra consecrated this Lingam, which is now believed to embody Lord Shiva’s grace and the power to dispel negative energies.

## Mythological Background

As per ancient texts, Indra once committed a sinful act, resulting in Brahmahatya Dosha (the sin of killing a Brahmin). To absolve this sin, he worshipped at many holy sites. During one such pilgrimage, he came to Thiruvannamalai, where he discovered a Shiva Lingam in a forest filled with Kadamba trees. He worshipped the Lingam by adorning it with lotus flowers, and through this devotion, he was relieved of his sin. It is at this sacred spot that the Indra Lingam was installed.

## Significance During Girivalam

During Pournami (Full Moon) Girivalam, it is considered highly auspicious to worship at the Indra Lingam for the following blessings:

> 🙏 Ego is reduced
> 🙏 As the Sun (Surya) and Venus (Shukra) govern the eastern direction, praying at this eastern Lingam is believed to bring their divine blessings
> 🙏 Mental strength, courage, fame, and leadership qualities are bestowed
> 🙏 Leadership abilities are enhanced
