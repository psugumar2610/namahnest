## Esanya Lingam – Location

The Esanya Lingam is located on the northeastern side of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the Esanya Mutt, close to the junction of the temple and Ramana Ashram Road. It is the eighth and final Lingam encountered during the sacred Girivalam (circumambulation) of Arunachala Hill.

This Lingam represents the Northeast direction, considered highly auspicious and spiritually charged. It is associated with the Sagittarius (Dhanus) and Pisces (Meena) zodiac signs. The Lingam was consecrated by Esanya, the guardian of the Northeast and the embodiment of spiritual wisdom and divine knowledge.

Devotees believe that worshipping here leads to moksha (liberation), peace of mind, divine intuition, and spiritual awakening.

## Historical Significance

According to sacred tradition, Esanya, the celestial guardian of divine wisdom, once sought deeper spiritual knowledge and eternal liberation. To fulfill this divine longing, he came to the sacred Arunachala and meditated with unwavering devotion upon Lord Shiva.

Shiva, pleased by Esanya’s dedication, blessed him with ultimate knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. As an expression of eternal gratitude, Esanya consecrated this Lingam, making it a center of inner awakening, purity, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## Mythological Background

Puranic lore tells that Esanya, although spiritually elevated, wished to be freed from subtle karmic bonds and worldly illusions. He arrived at Thiruvannamalai—where fire meets silence—and engaged in deep meditation beneath sacred trees, absorbing the powerful vibrations of Arunachala.

Lord Shiva appeared before him in a radiant form and offered him the state of eternal bliss (Ananda) and enlightenment. Esanya then installed this Lingam to help future generations attain the path of dharma, devotion, and moksha.

## Significance During Girivalam

On Pournami days, as devotees reach the Esanya Lingam—the final station of their spiritual journey—they offer their prayers for completion, reflection, and inner peace. Worship here is believed to offer:

🙏 Liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth (moksha)
🙏 Clarity of mind, enhanced meditation, and spiritual insight
🙏 Divine knowledge and wisdom
🙏 Cleansing of the soul and elevation of consciousness
🙏 Strengthens Jupiter (Guru), the planet of wisdom and dharma
🙏 Peaceful closure and fulfillment of the Girivalam journey
