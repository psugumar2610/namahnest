## Yama Lingam – Location

The Yama Lingam is located on the southern side of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the cremation grounds and along Chengam Road. This is the third Lingam encountered during the sacred Girivalam journey.

This Lingam represents the South direction and is associated with the Aries (Mesha) and Scorpio (Vrischika) zodiac signs. It was consecrated by Yama, the Lord of Death and Dharma. Worshipping at this Lingam is believed to bestow protection from untimely death, longevity, righteous living, and release from fear.

## Historical Significance

According to ancient tradition, Lord Yama—the ruler of death—sought to overcome the burden of his harsh duties. To balance his karma and receive Shiva’s grace, he came to Thiruvannamalai and meditated deeply upon Lord Shiva.

Pleased with his sincere penance, Lord Shiva relieved him of his spiritual burdens and granted him blessings. In gratitude, Yama consecrated this Lingam to Lord Shiva. It has since been worshipped as a source of protection from danger, untimely death, and mental distress.

## Mythological Background

It is said in the Puranas that Yama was once cursed for mistakenly claiming the life of a devout sage before his destined time. Seeking redemption, he journeyed to sacred places and finally reached Thiruvannamalai. There, under the shadow of Arunachala Hill, he found peace through deep meditation on Shiva.

Lord Shiva, moved by his devotion, forgave him and taught him the deeper meaning of dharma (righteousness). Yama then installed this Lingam as a symbol of divine justice and protection.

## Significance During Girivalam

During Pournami Girivalam, it is highly auspicious to offer prayers at the Yama Lingam, especially for the following blessings:
