## Vayu Lingam – Location

The Vayu Lingam is located on the northwestern side of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the intersection of the Girivalam route and the Vayu Theertham (sacred water source). It is the sixth Lingam encountered during the divine circumambulation of the Arunachala Hill.

This Lingam represents the Northwest direction and is associated with the Gemini (Mithuna) and Aquarius (Kumbha) zodiac signs. It was consecrated by Vayu, the God of Wind and Life Force (Prana). Worshipping at this Lingam is believed to bring long life, health, mental clarity, and spiritual progress.

## Historical Significance

Vayu Deva, the Lord of Wind and the subtle life force that sustains all beings, once found his energy scattered and misdirected. Longing for spiritual alignment, he came to Thiruvannamalai and meditated upon Lord Shiva at the foot of the sacred Arunachala Hill.

Impressed by his devotion, Lord Shiva blessed him with spiritual awareness and control over his vast energies. As an offering of gratitude, Vayu consecrated this Lingam, which today is revered for enhancing life energy, concentration, and inner vitality.

## Mythological Background

According to the ancient legends, Vayu was once caught in a cosmic imbalance where the breath of life (prana) across the worlds became unstable. Disturbed by the chaos it created in nature and among people, he sought forgiveness and clarity.

Vayu’s intense meditation at Arunachala moved Lord Shiva to bless him with renewed purpose and balance. In reverence, Vayu established this Lingam, representing the flow of divine energy that sustains both body and soul.

## Significance During Girivalam

On Pournami days, devotees pause at the Vayu Lingam to restore balance in body and mind. The spiritual benefits of this sacred Lingam include:

🙏 Long life and vitality
🙏 Relief from respiratory and nervous system disorders
