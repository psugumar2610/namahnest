## Kubera Lingam – Location

The Kubera Lingam is located on the northern side of the Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the Raja Gopuram (main temple tower). It is the seventh Lingam encountered during the sacred circumambulation of the Arunachala Hill.

This Lingam represents the North direction and is associated with the Virgo (Kanya) and Pisces (Meena) zodiac signs. It was consecrated by Kubera, the Lord of Wealth and Guardian of the North. Worshipping at this Lingam is believed to bless devotees with material prosperity, spiritual abundance, and peace of mind.

## Historical Significance

Kubera, though a divine treasurer, once grew attached to his wealth and lost sight of its true spiritual purpose. Realizing the karmic consequences of his pride, he came to Thiruvannamalai to seek redemption and a deeper understanding of divine dharma.

At the feet of Arunachala, he meditated sincerely on Lord Shiva. Pleased with his repentance and devotion, Shiva guided him toward the righteous use of wealth. In gratitude, Kubera consecrated this Lingam, which stands today as a symbol of divine prosperity, balance, and humility in abundance.

## Mythological Background

In Puranic tradition, Kubera was once cursed due to his arrogance over his immense wealth. To overcome the curse and restore divine favor, he undertook a pilgrimage and reached Thiruvannamalai, the land of fire and liberation. There, he immersed himself in austerity and devotion.

Shiva, pleased with his transformation, granted him wisdom and blessed him with the role of cosmic treasurer once again. Kubera then installed this Lingam as a sacred offering, representing spiritual richness over material attachment.

## Significance During Girivalam

During Pournami Girivalam, devotees visit the Kubera Lingam to receive both material and spiritual wealth. Prayers here are believed to bring:
