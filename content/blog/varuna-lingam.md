## Varuna Lingam – Location

The Varuna Lingam is situated on the western side of the sacred Girivalam path in Thiruvannamalai, near the town's drainage canal. It is the fifth Lingam encountered by devotees performing the holy circumambulation.

This Lingam represents the West direction and is associated with the Cancer (Kataka) and Capricorn (Makara) zodiac signs. It was consecrated by Varuna, the Vedic God of Water, Rain, and Cosmic Order. Worshipping here is believed to grant mental peace, emotional balance, health, and control over the senses and speech.

## Historical Significance

As per traditional accounts, Lord Varuna, who governs the water element and truth (Satya), once faced imbalance in his cosmic duties, leading to disturbances in nature and in human minds. Seeking to restore harmony, he journeyed to Thiruvannamalai and meditated on Lord Shiva.

Pleased with his penance, Shiva granted him the ability to balance emotions and natural forces again. In deep devotion and gratitude, Varuna consecrated this Lingam. Today, it is worshipped as a source of mental clarity, truthfulness, and internal purification.

## Mythological Background

According to Puranic texts, Varuna once failed to uphold dharma in managing the waters and truthfulness in the world, causing emotional unrest in humans. Burdened with this karmic lapse, he sought forgiveness and guidance at Arunachala.

There, he meditated with unwavering focus on Lord Shiva. The Lord appeared before him and absolved his karmic imbalance. Humbled and transformed, Varuna installed this Lingam to offer a place where devotees can wash away emotional burdens and attain mental peace.
